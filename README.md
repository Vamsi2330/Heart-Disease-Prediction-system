### Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

This Python script implements a series of machine learning models to predict heart disease based on a dataset containing various health metrics. The models include Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest, each of which is evaluated for accuracy and predictive performance.

#### Key Components

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**
   - The heart disease dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
   - The dataset is then split into features (`X`) and target (`Y`), followed by a train-test split to evaluate the models.

2. **Data Visualization:**
   - Several functions are provided to visualize the dataset, including correlation heatmaps, age distribution analyses, and pie charts showing the distribution of patients across age groups.
   - These visualizations help in understanding the relationships between different variables and the target (presence of heart disease).

3. **Model Implementation and Evaluation:**
   - **Logistic Regression:**
     - The `Logistic_regressor` class provides methods to train the model, evaluate accuracy, and generate a confusion matrix. It also includes a predictive system to classify new input data.
   - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):**
     - The `knn` class implements the KNN algorithm, offering methods for accuracy evaluation, confusion matrix generation, and a predictive system.
   - **Random Forest:**
     - The `random` class uses a Random Forest classifier, providing methods for accuracy evaluation, confusion matrix generation, and a predictive system.

4. **Model Accuracy and Confusion Matrices:**
   - Each model is evaluated for its accuracy on both the training and test datasets. The confusion matrices are generated to show the number of correct and incorrect predictions.

5. **Predictive Systems:**
   - Each model includes a predictive system that takes an individual's health metrics as input and predicts whether they have heart disease.

#### How to Use

- **Visualization Functions:** Call any of the visualization functions like `heatmap_corr()`, `age_analysis()`, etc., to understand the dataset better.
- **Model Evaluation:** Instantiate the corresponding class (`Logistic_regressor`, `knn`, or `random`) and call methods like `accuracy()` or `Confusion_matrix()` to evaluate the model.
- **Prediction:** Use the predictive system methods in each class to classify new data points.

#### Future Improvements

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** The models can be improved by fine-tuning hyperparameters using `GridSearchCV` or `RandomizedSearchCV`.
- **Additional Metrics:** Consider evaluating models using precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to handle class imbalance.
- **Modularization:** The code can be further organized by separating data preprocessing, visualization, and model training into different modules.
